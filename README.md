# Swoop
## Problem
Living in New York, you might find yourself putting items out onto your stoop for other New Yorkers to take. You might have posted these items on your Facebook for free with your cross streets listed â€“ but that makes you feel uneasy as you are giving strangers your address/cross streets.  


On the other side of the coin, maybe you are searching on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist to find free items, but searching within a radius makes the hunt extremely difficult as a 5-mile radius could put you in another borough or even in New Jersey. 

## Solution
Our application sets out to help New Yorkers post their unwanted items anonymously and allows their fellow neighbors the ability to search for items in their specific neighborhoods.
